# Feast feature store configuration
# ---
# Registry: PostgreSQL (via Docker) — shared, production-style metadata store.
# Offline store: Ray-backed — uses Ray for distributed point-in-time joins
#   during get_historical_features() calls. Falls back gracefully on small
#   datasets; shines when entity DataFrames have millions of rows.
